- **Error analysis**: Step-by-step breakdown of common Jinja2 errors
- **Compatibility validation**: Ensures recommendations work within Rewst's implementation
- **No speculative suggestions**: Only validated functionality from documented sources

## üöÄ When to Use

### Perfect For:

- **Workflow automation** requiring data transformation and templating
- **Integration patterns** connecting different systems through Rewst
- **Data manipulation** within Rewst automation workflows
- **Template debugging** when Jinja expressions aren't working as expected
- **Performance optimization** of existing Jinja templates
- **Learning Jinja2** specifically within the Rewst context

### Not Ideal For:

- **General Python development** (users can't interact with Python directly)
- **Standard Jinja2 usage** outside of Rewst platform
- **Complex algorithmic logic** better suited for other tools
- **Frontend templating** in web development contexts

## üí° Usage Tips

### Understanding Rewst Context

1. **No Python access**: Remember you're working within Rewst's workflow environment
2. **Enhanced features**: Leverage comprehensions and try-catch beyond standard Jinja2
3. **Filter validation**: All suggestions use documented Rewst filters only
4. **Workflow integration**: Consider how templates fit into broader automation flows

### Example Prompts

```
"I need to transform a list of users from an API response into a
formatted list for email notification. The API returns user objects
with name, email, and department fields."

"How can I safely handle API responses that might be missing
expected fields? I want to avoid workflow failures when data
structure varies."

"I have a complex nested JSON response and need to extract
specific values for different workflow branches. What's the
most efficient approach in Rewst?"
```

### Getting Best Results

- **Show your data structure**: Include examples of input data
- **Explain your goal**: What output format you need
- **Mention error messages**: Include any Jinja errors you're encountering
- **Provide context**: How this fits into your broader workflow

## üìä Enhanced Jinja2 Features in Rewst

### List/Dictionary Comprehensions

Standard approach:

```jinja2
{% set user_ids = [] %}
{% for user in CTX.list_of_users %}
  {% set _ = user_ids.append(user.id) %}
{% endfor %}
{{ user_ids }}
```

Enhanced Rewst approach:

```jinja2
{{ [user.id for user in CTX.list_of_users] }}
```

### Try-Catch Functionality

```jinja2
{% try %}
  {{ potentially_missing_field.value }}
{% catch %}
  "Default value"
{% endtry %}
```

### Custom Filters

Access to Rewst's specialized filter library for:

- **Data transformation**: Custom formatting and conversion
- **API response handling**: Specialized JSON and XML processing
- **Integration patterns**: Platform-specific data manipulation

## ‚ö° Best Practices

### Efficiency Guidelines

1. **Prefer comprehensions**: More efficient than manual loops for simple transformations
2. **Use try-catch**: Graceful error handling prevents workflow failures
3. **Leverage custom filters**: Take advantage of Rewst's specialized functionality
4. **Validate data structures**: Check for expected fields before processing

### Common Patterns

- **Safe data access**: Always handle potential missing keys/fields
- **Batch processing**: Efficient handling of lists and collections
- **Conditional logic**: Clean branching based on data conditions
- **Error recovery**: Graceful fallbacks when data doesn't match expectations

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Hardcoded values**: Use variables and context data instead
- **Complex nested loops**: Consider comprehensions or filter chains
- **Unhandled errors**: Always plan for data variations
- **Python-specific assumptions**: Remember Jinja2 limitations within Rewst

## üîç Error Analysis Framework

### Error Breakdown Process

1. **Error type identification**: Undefined variable, incompatible data type, etc.
2. **Context analysis**: What data was expected vs what was received
3. **Solution space**: Available filters, logic constructs, patterns that work
4. **Documentation verification**: Confirm all recommendations are validated

### Common Error Scenarios

- **Undefined variable errors**: When context data doesn't match expectations
- **Type errors**: Applying wrong operations to data types
- **Filter errors**: Using incorrect or non-existent filters
- **Syntax errors**: Malformed Jinja2 expressions

## üí≠ Knowledge Sources

### Validated References

- **Rewst documentation**: Complete platform documentation for context and patterns
- **Custom filters library**: Full filter reference with usage examples
- **Jinja comprehensions**: Enhanced syntax documentation and implementation details
- **Try-catch functionality**: Error handling patterns and best practices

### Reliability Commitment

- **No assumptions**: Every recommendation verified against documentation
- **Systematic validation**: Cross-reference solutions with multiple sources
- **Explicit uncertainty**: Clear statements when features aren't documented
- **Practical focus**: Solutions that work in real Rewst environments

## üéØ Example Use Cases

### Data Transformation

```jinja2
# Transform API user list to email-friendly format
{{ [user.email for user in users if user.active and user.department == 'IT'] }}
```

### Safe Data Access

```jinja2
# Handle potentially missing API fields
{% try %}
  {{ api_response.data.users | length }}
{% catch %}
  0
{% endtry %}
```

### Conditional Processing

```jinja2
# Different handling based on data type
{% if incident.priority == 'high' %}
  {{ incident | format_urgent_notification }}
{% else %}
  {{ incident | format_standard_notification }}
{% endif %}
```

## üí° Usage Tips

### Input Guidelines

1. **Share your raw thoughts**: Don't pre-polish‚Äîauthentic messiness works better
2. **Include your personality**: Quirks, opinions, specific perspectives
3. **Mention your audience**: Who should feel like they belong in this conversation?
4. **State your goal**: Inspire discussion, share insight, tell a story?

### Example Prompts

```
"I have thoughts about remote work culture from managing a distributed
team for 3 years. Help me turn these observations into something that
invites other managers to share their experiences."

"I wrote this reflection on creativity and burnout but it feels too
polished and generic. Help me make it sound like me‚Äîsomeone who's
actually lived this, not just read about it."

"These are my scattered notes on why most productivity advice doesn't
work. Turn this into something that gets people nodding and wanting
to add their own examples."
```

### Getting Best Results

- **Be specific about your voice**: Funny but not cynical, thoughtful but not preachy
- **Share your context**: What experiences shaped these thoughts?
- **Include contradictions**: Real thoughts are rarely perfectly consistent
- **Mention what you want to avoid**: Corporate buzzwords, generic advice, etc.

## üìä Writing Principles

### Always Emphasize

- **Plain language**: Simple, familiar words most people understand
- **Conversational tone**: Natural phrasing, like talking to a friend
- **Brevity with impact**: Short, punchy sentences (15-20 words max)
- **Scannable structure**: Descriptive subheadings, front-loaded key points

### Always Avoid

- **Buzzwords and business clich√©s**: Say things plainly instead
- **Overused transitions**: "However," "moreover," "indeed" are usually unnecessary
- **Pretentious verbs**: "Use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate"
- **Perfect polish**: Maintain the rough edges that make ideas compelling

### Content Structure

- **Favor observations**: Share what you've noticed, not what you know for certain
- **Leave breathing room**: Don't tie up every loose end
- **Use specific details**: Concrete examples over abstract concepts
- **Stop before preaching**: Let insights speak for themselves

## ‚ö° Voice & Tone Guidelines

### The Sweet Spot

- **Smart but accessible**: Intelligent without being intimidating
- **Warm but not saccharine**: Genuine friendliness, not fake positivity
- **Confident but not arrogant**: Share insights without claiming universal truth
- **Engaging but not demanding**: Invite discussion without requiring it

### Personality Markers

- **Nerdy references**: When they add genuine context or humor
- **Self-deprecation**: Disarming without being distracting
- **Specific observations**: "I noticed..." rather than "Studies show..."
- **Conversational asides**: Parenthetical thoughts that show your thinking

### Emotional Availability

- **Vulnerable honesty**: Share what you're actually thinking and feeling
- **Imperfect humanity**: Include doubts, changes of mind, contradictions
- **Generous curiosity**: Assume readers have valuable perspectives to add
- **Thoughtful authenticity**: Real person thinking out loud, not a content machine

## üéØ Before & After Example

**Before** (Overly polished):

> In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, organizations must leverage innovative strategies to optimize team productivity and enhance collaborative outcomes. By implementing best practices for remote work management, companies can facilitate improved performance metrics while simultaneously fostering a culture of engagement and accountability.

**After** (Human and discussable):

> I've been managing remote teams for three years now, and honestly? Most of the advice out there feels like it was written by people who've never actually done it.
>
> Here's what I've learned: The hard part isn't the technology or the processes. It's the weird psychological stuff nobody talks about. Like how you start reading way too much into the tone of Slack messages. Or how "quick sync" becomes code for "I'm lonely and need to see a human face."
>
> The teams that thrive aren't the ones with the best project management tools. They're the ones who figured out how to be weird together from a distance.

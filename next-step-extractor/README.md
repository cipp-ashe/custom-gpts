## 💡 Usage Tips

### Input Guidelines

1. **Don't pre-organize**: Dump everything—the messier, the better
2. **Include context**: Background, constraints, goals, stakeholders
3. **Share your confusion**: What's overwhelming or unclear
4. **Mention timeframes**: Urgency or deadline pressures

### Example Prompts

```
"I just had a 2-hour strategy meeting about our product roadmap.
Here are my scattered notes... What should I do first?"

"I'm launching a new service but feel overwhelmed by all the
moving pieces: marketing, operations, legal, funding.
What's my next step?"

"I've been researching this decision for weeks and have too much
information. Help me figure out what to do next to move forward."
```

### Getting Best Results

- **Include emotional state**: "I'm overwhelmed," "I'm stuck," "I'm confused"
- **Share stakes**: What happens if you don't act?
- **Mention resources**: Time, budget, team constraints
- **Be honest about blockers**: What's actually preventing action?

## 📊 Processing Framework

### Input Analysis

1. **Content parsing**: Extract essential elements from any format
2. **Recursive consideration**: Examine relationships and dependencies
3. **Dimensional insight**: Look beyond surface-level obvious actions

### Action Identification

- **Forward-motion bias**: Always suggests something actionable
- **Low-risk, high-leverage preference**: Maximizes learning with minimal risk
- **Clarity-seeking default**: When unclear, suggests ways to gain clarity

### Default Strategies

When next steps aren't obvious, applies:

- **First principles thinking**: What foundational element needs addressing?
- **Mental models**: Systems thinking to identify leverage points
- **Risk mitigation**: Low-cost experiments to test assumptions

## ⚡ Operating Principles

### Always Actionable

- **Never fails to suggest something**: There's always a path forward
- **Movement over perfection**: Perfect information doesn't exist
- **Bias toward action**: Doing something trumps analysis paralysis

### Systematic Approach

- **Finds clarity paths**: If action isn't obvious, suggests how to get clarity
- **Defines terms**: When definitions are unclear, makes that the next step
- **Takes smart risks**: Suggests low-risk, high-leverage experiments

### Scientific Mindset

- **Systems thinking**: Considers interconnections and leverage points
- **Evidence-based**: Grounds suggestions in what works
- **Experimental**: Frames actions as tests to learn from

## 🎯 Tone & Approach

**Clear, focused, and direct**—like a trusted assistant who speaks with:

- **Brevity**: Gets to the point quickly
- **Scientific thinking**: Logical, systematic approach
- **Systems perspective**: Understands interconnections
- **Willingness to elaborate**: Provides details when asked, but defaults to essentials

## 💭 Mental Models Applied

- **First principles thinking**: Breaking down to fundamentals
- **Inversion**: What would prevent success?
- **Systems thinking**: Understanding interconnections and feedback loops
- **Experimentation**: Treating actions as hypothesis tests
- **Constraint theory**: Identifying and addressing bottlenecks

## 🔍 Example Transformation

**Input** (Overwhelmed user):

> "I want to start a consulting business but I'm overwhelmed. I need to set up an LLC, build a website, create service packages, figure out pricing, develop marketing materials, network, find my first clients, set up accounting systems, get insurance... I don't know where to start and it all feels like it needs to happen at once."

**Output**:

> **Next Step**: Schedule three 30-minute conversations with people currently running consulting businesses similar to what you want to build.
>
> **Why This Matters**: Before building anything, you need to validate your assumptions about what clients actually want and will pay for. These conversations will clarify which of your overwhelming list actually matters and in what order.
>
> **Potential Blockers**: Finding the right people to talk to, fear of looking inexperienced, or not knowing what questions to ask. Start with your existing network—even loose connections often lead to valuable insights.

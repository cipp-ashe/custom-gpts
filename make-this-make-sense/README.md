4. **Constraints and Requirements**: Creative boundaries (team, tech, time, budget)

### Not Ideal For:

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Tips

### Input Preparation

1. **Dump everything**: Notes, ideas, quotes, data points, sketches
2. **Don't organize first**: The messier the betterâ€”let the GPT find the structure
3. **Include context**: Who's the audience? What's the goal?
4. **Share constraints**: Budget, timeline, team limitations

### Example Prompts

```
"Here are my scattered notes from a customer discovery session.
Turn this into a one-pager that gets the engineering team
excited about solving this user pain point."

"I have screenshots of competitor features and random thoughts
about our product gaps. Make this into a strategic document
that justifies why we should build this next."

"Voice memo transcript + Slack thread + user feedback.
Transform into a compelling problem statement that gets
leadership to approve the project."
```

### Getting Best Results

- **Include raw data**: Customer quotes, metrics, feedback
- **Share your hunches**: Even half-formed ideas can be valuable
- **Mention the stakes**: What happens if this problem isn't solved?

## ðŸ“Š Success Framework

### Problem Definition

2. **Include voices**: Customer quotes, team feedback, stakeholder concerns
3. **Think thriller, not textbook**: Lead with tension and stakes
4. **Focus on "so what?"**: Every section should answer why it matters
5. **Test with teammates**: Does it make them want to start building?
